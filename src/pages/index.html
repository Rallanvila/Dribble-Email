				Hey, designers! If you’ve ever wanted to master the fundamentals of mobile
				padding-top: 30px !important; app and interface design, now’s your chance.
				<strong>This is your last call</strong> to join Dribbble and Full-Stack
				Designer Jesse Showalter this <strong>Friday, March 26</strong> for two
				live, interactive Dribbble Workshops where you’ll learn how to design and
				deliver mobile interfaces as a freelancer or a team.
				<br />
				<br />
				In these two highly interactive workshop sessions, you’ll be getting your
				hands dirty on a project, sharing your work with Jesse, and getting
				real-time feedback from the expert himself. Plus, a lucky few will get the
				chance to join Jesse on virtual stage where he’ll review and rework your
				designs in real time!
